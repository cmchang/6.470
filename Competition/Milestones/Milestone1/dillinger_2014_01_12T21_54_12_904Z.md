Milestone 1

User Research
-----
1. With social media today, many people are interested in where their friends have been, which places they like to hangout at, what food the like to eat, and figure out the popular locations to visit in general within their friend group.  Most of the websites that make restaurant suggestions (i.e. Yelp), make suggestions based on everyone’s experience so our website will make recommendations purely on friends’ posts. 
 
 Our application is designed to help people find the best restaurant and activity suggestions based on their direct friends’ experiences. People usually have similar tastes to their friends so it will give much more personalized recommendations. Our site is going to be very visually based.  
Every post will be made with a picture and a location tagged with it.  We intended for users to post about restaurants, stores, events with friends, and other various activities. 

 For pictures of food and dishes they ate, we will implement a way to rate it. Their friends can also rate the food based on the picture and our site will then take those recommendations to find the best restaurants for each user. 

2. The killer feature of our application is the fact that it is completely visually based. The homepage will have a newsfeed and a photostream along with a map with the restaurant locations that have been recommended. But in terms of rating people don’t need to write long reviews and then sort through and read them for recommendations. They can simply view pictures of their friends’ at all of these restaurants and also just see what their friends have been doing and eating based on pictures. That will make the site much more fun to look at since people love looking at pictures of food and other activities. 

 Since we are keeping track of all the posts in database in chronological order, we can have a timeline for each user showing all the pictures/locations they have been too over time.  Unlike Facebook, the timeline won’t b include posts/comments from other people and will be purely of all the fun or interesting events the user posted about and the timeline will serve more like a journal recapping all the various experiences.

3. Our target demographic is social media users, namely young adults. We are mainly focusing on people who live in urban areas since they are going to be the people that are probably more interested in getting restaurant and other activity ideas. Since we are going to try to link our site to Facebook we are going to mainly target people who already use Facebook.  Our website would also attract those who enjoy writing journals because they can create a whole timeline of all the places they’ve been to.

4. For the task of uploading pictures: 

 * the user can click an upload button from the home page and a file viewer will come down, allowing them to pick a picture from their computer (and hopefully we can work on linking it to their facebook pictures for easier access if we have time/the right skills!)
 * the user can write a comment and/or tag friends
 * once they selected a picture they can view it and upload it along with a tagged location (if we figure out the google map API, they will then have the option of pinning the picture on the google map to the location where they took it)
 * the picture will be saved to their account and the server
 * they will have the option of rating their experience

2. 

 - **Option 1**: the pros are you are immediately drawn in by the constantly updated newsfeed, the big map with recommendations, and the photostream. In addition, it is very easy to navigate with the top nav bar, you can search easily, and it isn’t too cluttered. The cons are that there might be too much updated stuff and you won’t know where to look, the map might not be big enough (but you can zoom out if you need), and it might not look as appealing to new users. 

 - **Option 2**: The pros are the page is more simplistic and has a clean look. Additionally, with this layout we would not have to use the google map API and it may be more realistic to implement within the given timeframe. The cons of this page is that it is a little less visually appealing, and there would be more text on the page.

 - **Option 3**: the pros are that the map is the key feature when you log in, it is a very simplistic and visually pleasing design, and it is easy to find anything you need. The cons however are it might not draw new users in because they won’t have a map with recommendations (we could put general top rated things on there for new users but it still might not be as inviting to new users), it might be too simplistic and not advertise the features enough, and the menu bar looks too similar to Facebook.

MVP:
---------
1. 
 - For our MVP we are going to make sure that users can successfully upload, rate, save, and tag pictures.  That is going to be crucial for our website since without user uploaded pictures our site won’t be very worthwhile. 
 - The other most important feature will be making sure that our site actually makes informed recommendations based on friends’ ratings.  The first step to doing this is just getting our backend database working so we can implement the recent activity newsfeed and create a basic filter based on tags (i.e. food, restaurants, retail shops, etc.).
 - We need to be able to add friends and keep track of that in our database 
 - We hope to be able to implement basic google map functions.  The first start is to just keep track of the individual user’s locations on a google map.  If we can implement this, we will work to add the google map on the news feed to combine the locations of various friends.

2. For our MVP we won’t focus as much on the map implementation in the newsfeed since we can have the same functional website without the map.  However, the map would be extremely nice to have since we would our website to be very visually based.  We also won’t spend as much time making the picture rating as visually pleasing as we will want it for our final submission. 

3. We won’t deal with security concerns for our MVP since our website isn’t going to have that much secure information on it. We will deal with that for our final submission.  However, if we figure out the correct API, we can make our website linked with a facebook account so the user does not have to type in a password through our website or we could make the website only available to MIT students for the Beta version so students can use their certificates to log in. 

Additional Questions:
----------
1. 
 - Frances Rucker - frucker@mit.edu, MIT, 6-3, 2016, undergraduate
 - Carolyn Chang - changc@mit.edu, MIT, 6-3, 2016, undergraduate

2. Our website best matches the urban living tool since it will help people explore the city they live in based on their friend’s experiences.

3. We plan to use node.js and Firebase.

4. Neither of us have any experience with back-end website programming so it will be hard to learn node.js and get a functioning database and link our site with facebook for login and information from our users. But we are doing a lot of node.js practice problems and tutorials so hopefully those will help.  For our website, we will also have to learn the Google Map API and possibly the Facebook API. 

5. We plan on competing in the rookie division. 

Dillinger is a cloud-enabled HTML5 Markdown editor.

  - Type some Markdown text in the left window

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site] [1]:

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable 
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.
